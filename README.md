__What is Programming ?__
 - When th program start taking decision based on the condition.

 **Basic Of any Programming language**
1. Value
2. variable
3. operation
4. Decision
5. function
6. Loop

**1. Value**

**It** is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program.

eg: 80 , 'deepak' ansd so on...

**2. variable**

**It** is used to store the value.

eg: a = 80, name = 'deepak'

*there are three keywords that are used to declare a variable that are **VAR LET CONST.***


**3. operation/ Operator**

**It** is used to perform different mathamtical and logical actions.

*There are three type of operation  __arithmetic, logical, and relational__*

eg: +,-,*,/,%,++,-- and so on ...


**4. Decision**

**It** allows the program to make a Choice.


___**if, else, else if**___ are used to execute a specified block of code if the condition is true.
    
    
    if(condition){
        statment;
    }
``
`` 
       
       
    if(condition1){
        statment1;
    }
    else if (condition2) {
        statment2;
    }
    else{
        statment3;
    }

**Ternary Operator**
    
    condition ? statment1 : statment2 ;

    If condition is true then statment1 will execute. Otherwise, statment2 will execute.

 **5. function**
